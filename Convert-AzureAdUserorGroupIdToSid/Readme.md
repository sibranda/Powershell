Several times you need to Convert Azure AD User or Group Object ID to SID.
Example: to use in Intune Profile to Add Local Administrator to Local Admin Group in Windows 10/11

This Script intend to help you to convert the Object ID to SID.

The script allow you to connect to your Azure Tenant and Search User or Group by Name.

I Hope this can be usefull to you.

Thanks
